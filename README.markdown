This is the Crystal Collector game, made using Javascript and jQuery.

After I finished the functionality of the game, I spent a little time working on
the layout using custom CSS, and I designed the crystal icons using
Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.

I also felt that the game instructions were too long and obtrusive, so I added
a button that allows the user to open and close them as needed.

I would like to improve the UX by adding a satisfying popup that momentarily 
breaks gameplay to tell the user if they won or lost the round before moving
on to the next round.
